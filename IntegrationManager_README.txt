-------------------------------------------------
<Describe here any instructions that will be needed by course staff to build,
 run, and test this project.>
`make run` or `make` builds the project and runs it
`make compile` builds the project

Upon running the project, press enter to go to the Main Menu.
There are 3 options plus exit, enter the number:
  1. Get a sequence of cities of the shortest path between two cities
  2. Get a list of all available cities in this GPS
  3. Get a list of all neighboring cities in this GPS of a city
  0. Exit the program

In option 1, user will be prompted twice: 1. the starting city, 2. the destination city.
Once both are entered, a sequence of cities of the shortest path between the entered
cities are printed in order with the subsequent city at the next line. User can press 0
to exit to go back to the Main Menu.

In option 3, user will be prompted for a city in the GPS. A list of cities neighboring
the entered city and the distances between the entered city and the neighboring cities
in the internal graph of the program are entered.
